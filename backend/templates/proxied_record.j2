Hello!

A proxied record has been added to your domain, {{ domain }}. The delivr.dev caching proxy is a highly experimental feature and therefore requires manual verification by an administrator. Please allow up to 48 hours for an admin to take a look.

In case you haven't already, make sure at least one of your domain's authorized users has created an ACL for protected HTTP operations. Check out this page for more information: https://delivr.dev/docs/caching-proxy/#acl-configuration

As always, feel free to send an email to info@delivr.dev if you need anything!

Cheers,
delivr.dev
