The delivr.dev Edge Cache Appliance (ECA) is an authoritative delivr.dev DNS server wrapped in an easy to install software or hardware package to deploy in your network. ECAs can be deployed as a dedicated server, VM, or even a SBC like the Raspberry Pi. If you're interested in deploying an ECA in your network, send an email to <span style={{"unicode-bidi": "bidi-override", direction: "rtl"}}>ved.rviled@ofni</span> to get the application started.
